This directory contains "MEDLINE 1033 Abstracts" dataset containing three files MED.ALL, MED.QRY and MED.REL (plus MED.ALL fragmented).

(I could not find the original dataset and its documentation on the Web. However, I was able to salvage these from an old archive of the sources 
and data of an IR demo application I had built more than a decade back.)

--------------

MED.ALL is a single document containing 1033 "documents" (titles and abstracts),  separated in a simple way.

MED.QRY consists of queries you can issue. (Make sure you DO NOT restrict the size of the query to enable using this dataset.)

MED.REL provides relevance judgements -- it gives the number of query and the documents that are considered relevant according to a human judge. (Ignore the trailing zeros.)
